Processing:

1. Collect necessary files and place them in the "input" folder
	a) my_file.raw from the instrument computer
	b) my_file.xml containing the xml output from Mascot search
		- v2.1.03: when exporting the xml, be sure to choose the "input query data" checkbox.
		- v2.4.1: 

2.Input any desired processing parameters
	a) Exclude Precursor Contamination 
		- % : Minimum allowable percentage of largest ion series peak
		- +/- m/z : isolation window width

3. Click "Get File" and select the RAW file to be validated.

4. Wait for data to be collected and pre-processed.


Validation:

1. Proteins will be listed in the order they appear in the Mascot search.

2. Beneath each protein in the list of Mascot ID's for peptides that belong to the protein
	- If the sequence is black, beneath it will be possible combinations of post-translational modifications
	- If the sequence is red, it has been excluded from the preliminary processing 
		- The reason for pre-exclusion will be listed above the MS2
		- User may "Process Anyway"
	- If an assignment is acceptable, click the green "Accept" button.
		- Assignments marked in green will be included in the "output\my_file\accept" folder upon printing accept list
		- Any quantitative data from iTRAQ or SILAC will be included in the "output\my_file\my_file.xls" upon printing accept list
	- If an assignment is unacceptable, click the red "Reject" button.
	- If an assignment needs further examination, click the orange "Maybe" button.
